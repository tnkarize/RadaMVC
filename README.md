# mvcFramework
Back in 2009, code igniter did not meet my needs, so i had to create a new framework based on code igniter but with some better features like templating, scaffolding and an ORM 


Very easy to install:

just set it in your include path in your php configuration and then follow the guidelines in the code on utilization. 

Supports method chaining :)
